# Function Point Analysis Calculator

This repository contains a C++ implementation of a Function Point Analysis (FPA) calculator. The calculator is used to estimate the size of a software project based on its functional requirements.

## Overview

Function Point Analysis is a standardized method used to measure the size and complexity of software by quantifying its functionality. This tool calculates the Unadjusted Function Points (UFP) and then adjusts them based on a set of complexity factors to determine the final Function Points (FP).

## Features

- **Calculate Unadjusted Function Points (UFP)**
- **Adjust Function Points based on complexity factors**
- **Output detailed results**

## How to Use

1. **Set Up the Environment**

   Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed. This code was written in C++ and requires a standard C++ environment to compile and run.

2. **Compile the Code**

   Use the following command to compile the code:

   ```sh
   g++ -o fpa_calculator fpa_calculator.cpp
